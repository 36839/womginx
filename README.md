## Site compatibility

What works:
1. recaptcha
2. discord with actual login credentials (no qr code required)
3. websocket sites
4. sites that have cookies

What doesn't work:
1. react sites
2. sites that depend on window.location and are minified
3. YouTube UI (however, you can watch a video like https://proxysite.com/main/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vidid and it will work)
